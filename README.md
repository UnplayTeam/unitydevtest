This will be archived but publicly available for sometime after. The next time
we have need of a technical skills test, we will make a whole new random
challenge!
______________________________________________________________________________

Create a functional UI for the morphing v008 LiveTale Character model!

Inside this project, you will find a 3d model. This is an older novel custom 3d model consisting of many mesh renderers, bones, and blendshapes. We have since changed many things about our internal model, and decided to repurpose this for interview purposes. The blendshapes include many options, but most notable blending for fantasy species and body shapes. This project utilizes the LTS version of Unity 2021, however it should seemlessly load in all versions of Unity 2022 as well.

Note that in exploring this 3d model, you will discover dozens of SkinnedMeshRenderers, each with a multitude of blendshape definitions. The naming of the blendshapes indicates some blendshapes that benefit from being modified in unison in order to avoid mesh seam breakages. Exploring this model and making sense of it is part of this task.

The model itself is property of Unplay, Inc. and cannot be used for other purposes without explicit permission from Unplay, Inc.

Requirements:
- Your solution is yours! We will not use your code for our work. 
- Donâ€™t get stuck! Consult with Unity docs, Google, ChatGPT, friends, and anything/anyone else you feel will be useful.
- The resulting project should run in a scene and feature a Unity canvas-based UI.
- The UI should, at a minimum, allow the user to blend the human, orc, elf, muscularity, weight, and sex characteristics.
- All customization allowed in the UI should result in a consistent looking character output (e.g. no major mesh breakages).
- If the inspiration strikes you, feel free to explore other customizations that are in the model.
- Expect to talk about your solution in detail in any followup interview.
- Email faye@unplay.com a link to your PR and any contact info you want to provide if you are interested in applying!

Emphasis on how you choose to structure your Canvas UI, supporting code, and your ability to make sense of the provided model and manipulate data in it.

Fork this and make a PR back with your results!
